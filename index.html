						Yes, I thought that making the current presentation in English will be quite distintive. But lets start with the Self-evaluation!

						<h2>Evaluation</h2>
						<p>It was maybe one of the first things that we'd done,</p>
						<p>gladly we have the wiki and Internet to remember some tricks</p>
						<p>and the steps that we should follow. Thanks to that I didn't have any problem.</p>
						<p>I don't really know how to evaluate that... maybe</p>
						<h2>7?</h2>
						<p>Mostly because of the ability to solve problems</p>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Evaluation</h2>
						<p>Well... this one is harder. I have no problems with NodeJS(at least as a beginner).</p>
						<p>Although I had some problems with Browserify, I had solved them... but some times something explodes.</p>
						<p>Gulp is fine... That's it, I love the tool and Elixir (have problems with last exercise, though).</p>
						<p>And np with npm (xD).</p>
						<h2>6</h2>
						<p>I think I lack from some experience</p>

						<h2>Evaluation</h2>
						<p>This part I have in control, at least the first time. I have to touch the wiki only.</p>
						<p>For the second part I think I need review it latter on, that did I was with fever</p>
						<p>(Not Saturday fever, just 39Cº)</p>

						<h2>PHPUnit</h2>
						<p>I will tell you the true, I had to look in the wiki to remember what it was...</p>
						<p>Nonetheless, I think it was one of the few exercises that I didn't have much problems!</p>

				<section>
					<h2>PHPdoc and Javadoc</h2>
					<p>Nothing much to say, I use it when I remember, mostly because I don't have much time in class,</p>
					<p>It isn't an excuse, really, if you want I can show you some other codes when I have more comments than code</p>
					<p>I really love both cause I put a lot of comments. Although I'm not interested in do an API web,</p>
					<p>at least in my current project. Its private, I know that you don't like that xD</p>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Evaluation</h2>
						<p>Well I hadn't used Monolog much, although I do debug a lot (and I think than I do better than an average student),</p>
						<p>and I say that because they don't read the actual Debugger, wich helps you a lot.</p>
						<p>I had solve a lot of problems by my own (I had problems everyday and I only called you 4 times in the year).</p>
						<p>Ny self-evaluation could be higher but Monolog is my kryptonite</p>
						<h2>7</h2>
						<p>I don't like JetBrains' Debugger. Maybe just for esthetics.</p>

					<h2>Laravel Testing</h2>
					<p>Now I think that this could go with PHPUnit... It was quite impressive and I like it like some others "hacks" of laravel.</p>
					<p>Although I hadn't problems in the hole exercise at the end it giveme a lot of troubles.</p>
					<h2>5</h2>
					<p>I think I could have done something more.</p>
					<a href="#/2"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left"> Back to the list</i></a>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>JUnit</h2>
					<p>The same than before, altoough I touched it one day and never again.</p>
					<p>I will need to review it in the future.</p>
					<h2>5</h2>
					<p>I think I don't have nothing of this in the wiki.</p>
					<a href="#/2"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left"> Back to the list</i></a>

				<section>
					<h2>Profiling</h2>
					<p>Well another dilemma. I always watch for eficiency at the time of programing.</p>
					<p>Santi a lot of times tells me that I have to do the code and then try to optimize it,</p>
					<p>but I have problems to translate it into OOP profiling... There are some tricks that I need to master.</p>
					<h2>8</h2>
					<p>Still a lot of work to do, but I saw that I'm one of the most concerned about this.</p>

					<h2>Mediawiki</h2>
					<h2>5</h2>
					<p>Rush for the score xD</p>
					<p>I had a lot of things to add and this weekend I didn't have time to do it.</p>
					<p>But! I'm interested on this theme and I will ending up making my own wiki (I don't want to use yours forever).</p>
					<p>I have implemented some of the things that I could while I was in class, but I know that for this Holidays I will finish it.</p>

					<h2>Github and README files(Markdown format)</h2>
					<p>Well it giveme some problems at the beging but I'm just learning.</p>
					<p>I'm using GitHub for my personal projects (I work on Windows and Elementary) and I do an execise with Pau Forés with Java, for Santi.</p>
					<p>But I newbie to this Markdown format, but I don't see myself doing it wrong</p>

						<h4>This will take some more of your time, sorry...</h4>
						<p>First of all, its Friday and I'm 3 days late. But it wasn't for willing.</p>
						<p>On Monday my hard disk decided unilaterally to die. Screen freeze, strange sounds, and goodbye.
							Fortunately; I know that this will happend for somethings that I noticed lately and already have another. The problem was that trying to install the new Windows in the new Hard Disc I broke, somehow, my usb. I mean the logic part. Shop clossed, asked for a friend to let me one (suddenly all the usb of the house disapeared...). Installed Windows 10, after a day... But then... My BIOS went crazy and change the configuration.
						<p>In brief, I had to recovery my Linux HDD and fix the configuration of the BIOS (after recovery I couldn't use keyboard and mouse)</p>
						<p>I ended today at 10 am. Shit happens and I just wanted to explain it to you. I don't ask for forgiveness, just tell you  the true. I will understand if it doesn't change my score, in fact, I don't spect it to do it</p>

						<h2>Strengths</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>I love your subject and maybe you are the professor with I learn more. I'm not praising you, it is just what I think. My problem is that you go faster than I can follow, I have to learn something first and then I could start to use it well.</li>
							<li>I'm dedicated, when I have time. I can tell you that I was able to work 12 hours and more without rest and food (some snacks or lights meals).</li>
							<li>I can learn easy and help my mates. I'm always helping Roger when he is behind and he return the favor doing the same.</li>
							<li>I press atention. Although I'm not the ones that tackes notes, I first need to understand a concept to translate it into "my language".</li>
							<li>I love programming. The posibility to make almost everything for myself and with no need to depend in others (It is not like I don't want to... It's just that others have shutdown projects and I like the idea that I have to posibility to do it for myself). And I saw than others don't have such love like I do.</li>
						</ul>
						<div>
							<i class="fa fa-angle-double-down fa-2x"></i>

					<section>
						<h2>Weaknesses</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Lack of time. I spend, on average, 11 hours at day working. Somedays 6 on practices and 5 at school, but others I have class in the morning. I usually only have 5 hours for the rest (the others 8 I spend them sleeping), and in those hours I eat, travel and go to the bathroom. No time for practice</li>
							<li>I'm born off when I finish the week. Maybe its because the 11 hours per day I expend them with code, but although I try I can't program at home, I spend hours in front of the screen with the IDE without doing shit. And the problem is that I want to and I like it. I can't explain why, but I cant.</li>
							<li>I don't have the Wiki to the day.</li>
							<li>I have personal problems that, if you want, you can read below but those are afecting my current performance, and will explain more why I cannot work in my freetime. If you don't want to you can just finish.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Personal Record</h4>
						<p>I fell into a deep depression two years ago. A friend died, I was alone away from home (and I came from Argentina so I didn't have nobody) and some others problems. In the end I almost end in the hospital, but somehow I could continue without drugs or psychologists just by pure will strenght.</p>
						<p>At the end of last year I felt again for another personal matter and I almost lost the hole year. This time I'm goig to the psychologist and she tells me to take this year with calm.</p>
						<p>But in our family, like others, its in a critical economy situation, and I need to start to work next year. And I have my girlfriend living on Madrid, and I have to go there ASAP. So I need to finish this year, that¡s why I don't have timefree and when I have it I'm not in the mood of working</p>
						<p>And this weeks I just foundout that this may be the last year that my family (that leaves here at least) to be together because it's likely that my parents will get divorced sooner or later.</p>
						<p>I don't think that I could do more for this subjects, but I cannot afford to repeate this year nether. But I'm trying my best, I promise!</p>
